# ðŸš€ SpaceX Launches

## Welcome to My Space Adventure!

Hey there! I'm thrilled to share my latest project with youâ€”a fun little website that brings SpaceX launch data right to your screen. Using the [SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API), I set out to explore the world of REST APIs and see what kind of magic I could create with jQuery.

## My Mission

With only an hour and a half on the clock, I wanted to see how quickly I could whip up something cool, arming myself with Bootstrap for a quick and polished design. The outcome? An interactive journey through SpaceX launches that you can enjoy right from your screen!
